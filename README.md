# FYS-STK4155

The codes-folder contains the code implemented for project 1. The plots produced from the sample run folder comes from the main.py. For the case of simplicity, I've only included the MSE analyses for OLS Franke funtion using bootstrap. The complexity function ran in main.py should also produce the mse and r2-score for the optimal polynomial degree. In the sample run, those values were:

min mse: 0.005057859199036065
r2: 0.9268786637993607
deg: 5.0

N.B the heatmap/grid search were produced in Altair, thus it will not work if that package is not installed.

The terrain data can be found on the terrain_data folder.
